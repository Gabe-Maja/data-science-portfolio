For this project I was assigned to a team of 5 individuals. We then decided to allocate 2 Project Managers as co-leaders for this project. Myself and another individual took on this role. We made use of external tools (to ensure the success of this project) such as:
 Trello (project management) Streamlit (model deployment) Comet (version control) MS Powerpoint (project presentation)  A basic project breakdown and the steps we followed can be found below:</description>
